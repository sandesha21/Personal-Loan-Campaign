# Personal Loan Campaign

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting which existing bank customers are most likely to purchase a personal loan. By leveraging customer demographic, financial, and behavioral data, the project aims to support the marketing team in designing targeted campaigns, improving conversion rates, and increasing revenue from loan products.

## Objective  
The main objective was to build a predictive model that identifies potential customers who are likely to accept a personal loan offer. By analyzing key attributes such as income, credit card spending, account balance, and online banking usage, the project provides actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Provided as part of the project coursework  
- **Size:** ~5,000+ customer records  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Demographic details (age, education, family)  
  - Financial behavior (income, mortgage, credit card usage)  
  - Banking behavior (online activity, existing products)  
- **Target:** Loan Acceptance (`1` = Accepted, `0` = Not Accepted)

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Explored relationships between customer attributes and loan acceptance using visualizations and statistical analysis.  
3. **Model Development** – Built and evaluated classification models to predict loan acceptance and compared their performance.  
4. **Insights & Recommendations** – Identified key drivers of loan adoption and provided recommendations for targeted marketing efforts.

## Results & Key Insights  
- Highlighted high-income, credit-active customers as the most likely to accept loan offers.  
- Revealed key demographic and behavioral factors influencing conversion decisions.  
- Delivered recommendations for designing personalized marketing strategies to maximize ROI.

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
